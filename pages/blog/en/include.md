We are looking for multiple-choice tests in any language to add to the multicultural INCLUDE benchmark.  
Fill out the [form](https://forms.gle/wRnoxvTq7MKg5dpw9) now!

It is often said that large language models (LLMs) are developing increasingly advanced multilingual capabilities, but in which languages exactly? In the case of languages spoken in several countries, which varieties of the language are being considered? If we aim for LLMs to be multilingual and multicultural, we need to ensure that the entire global community is represented in the datasets. Change starts by creating diverse evaluation benchmarks that allow us to measure the current state and make progress toward truly inclusive LLMs.

[INCLUDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19799) is a multilingual LLM evaluation benchmark with a cultural focus. The first version, published in December 2024, included 42 languages, including Spanish (from Peru and Spain). To extend this benchmark and make it more representative, SomosNLP is seeking tests in Spanish from all Spanish-speaking countries and in all languages spoken in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Spain.
