Each participating team will generate a corpus of instructions, train their LLM, and create a demo to share their great work with the community. This year the focus is on projects that represent the richness of Spanish and the diversity of Spanish-speaking people. As always, we encourage projects to have a social impact and be related to one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Thank you for participating! ‚ú®
