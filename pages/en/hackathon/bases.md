Each participating team will generate a corpus of instructions, train their LLM, and create a demo to share their great work with the community. This year the focus is on projects that represent the richness of Spanish and the diversity of Spanish-speaking people. As always, we encourage projects to have a social impact and be related to one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Thank you for participating! ‚ú®

## ‚úÖ Steps to participate

Participating in our hackathon and applying your knowledge to democratize NLP in Spanish is very simple, go for it!

1. Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/my8w7JUxZR) community (and introduce yourself in #intros!)

2. Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and join the [SomosNLP](https://huggingface.co/organizations/somosnlp/share/qgytUhPKvxVxsbZWTzVUAUSUnZmVXNPmjc) organization.

3. Register on [Eventbrite](https://hackathonsomosnlp2024.eventbrite.com/?aff=w), choose the "Hackathon (English)" ticket.

4. Create your team or join one (teams of 1 to 5 people). Teams must be registered in the #encuentra-equipo channel (more info in the channel's README).

5. Create your corpus in the hf.co/SomosNLP org, we encourage you to create a corpus of instructions originally in Spanish. We recommend using the distilabel library. Soon, the Argilla team will publish an example notebook.

6. Write the Dataset Card for your dataset: inspect the dataset, evaluate, and mitigate biases.

7. Fine-tuning of an LLM for the task you have chosen and push to hub. We will provide you with 24GB GPU VMs, let us know when you have the dataset and everything is ready to start training. Remember that it is very important to test on more humble machines to verify that the code is correct and not find errors after several hours of training.

8. Write the Model Card for your model: evaluate its quality, biases, and carbon footprint. Important: link the dataset used for training.

9. Create a demo to showcase your project to the community. You can use Nvidia T4 - small GPUs. Important: link the dataset(s) and model(s) used.

10. Submit your project by filling out a form that we will publish soon. You can continue making modifications until 23h59 Anywhere on Earth on Sunday, March 24 (we will check the commit times üëÄ).

If you have any questions, we are at your disposal in the #pide-ayuda channel, write a descriptive title and use the "hackathon" tag.

We wish you much success! üöÄ

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>Can I participate if I'm not from a Spanish-speaking country?</summary>

Absolutely! While the focus of the hackathon is on the Spanish language and its varieties, we welcome participants from all over the world. Diversity enriches the projects and the community!

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why should I participate?</summary>

By joining this hackathon, you will have the opportunity to:

- ‚úÖ Understand how large language models (LLMs) work and discover the challenges of each stage of their development: corpus creation, training, and evaluation
- ‚úÖ Participate in the creation of a quality and diverse corpus that includes the different varieties of Spanish and co-official languages (top as an experience and top for the CV)
- ‚úÖ Resolve all your doubts about NLP during "Ask Me Anything" mentoring sessions
- ‚úÖ Receive support to present your work in a paper
- ‚úÖ Win prizes to continue growing as a professional and get a certificate
- ‚úÖ Join the largest community of Spanish speakers who study, work, and research in NLP

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the required level?</summary>

From the SomosNLP team, we want to encourage you to participate regardless of your current knowledge. In previous editions, we have had groups from research institutes and groups of undergraduate students, all projects add up!

- üìñ We will hold a series of **hands-on workshops** showing you how to develop a project so you have a reference example. To warm up, you can watch those from the previous edition:

  - [Fine-tuning LLMs (Manu Romero)](https://somosnlp.org/hackathon-2023/fine-tuning-llms)
  - [Data Labeling with Argilla (Daniel Vila)](https://somosnlp.org/hackathon-2023/data-labeling-with-argilla)

- ‚ùì We will organize **AMAs** (Ask Me Anything) with experts and mentors to solve your doubts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What does the complexity of the projects depend on?</summary>

We will provide an example of how to create a dataset, train a model, and create a demo. It's up to you and your team to choose how much to research and work to improve the base version. The difficulty also depends on the use case, the origin of the data, the time you dedicate to its curation, the training technique, the iterations you make, and how elaborate you want your demo to be. You are free to choose everything!

</details>

<details>
<summary>How long do I have to form a team?</summary>

Ideally all teams will be registered during the first week of the hackathon, until March 8th.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I find a team?</summary>

Finding a team is easy! Check the README of the #encuentra-equipo channel on our Discord server!

You have two options:
- üëÄ Look for posts from other participants who are looking for team members and respond to them, OR
- üì¢ Create a new thread specifying the topic you would like to work on

We encourage diversity in teams, including a mix of skills, experiences, and backgrounds. This diversity often leads to more innovative and comprehensive projects.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can there be teams of 1 person?</summary>

Yes, we accept teams between 1 and 5 people.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you recommend organizing the work?</summary>

- Use your project channel on Discord to communicate and organize
- Since it's an international hackathon, we recommend asynchronous communication or dividing the work and holding meetings with fewer people
- Schedule meetings or talk spontaneously using the new voice channels in the "SALAS DE REUNI√ìN" (meeting rooms) category on Discord
- Pin important messages in the project channel, e.g., task allocation, day of the next meeting, ... To pin a message, click on the three dots and select "Pin message"
- For better clarity, you can also create a shared document with team members to write down the project's objective, allocate tasks, and more (and pin the link in the chat)
