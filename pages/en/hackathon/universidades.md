Hi teacher!

This hackathon is an ideal experience for your students to improve their knowledge about Artificial Intelligence, particularly about language models in the real world: challenges, development, applications, risks, and much more ü§ì

## ‚ùì Questions you have done for us

- Can I use the hackathon as a classroom activity? Yes, if the dates and conditions set for the rest of the participants are respected.
- Is there a maximum number of teams per university or teacher? No, the more the better!
- Can you give a presentation talk about the community and the event for my university or class? Yes, please reach out to us as soon as possible to set the date.
- Some of my students do not speak Spanish, is this a problem? No, everyone is welcome, in this edition all instructions will be translated into English.
- *NEW!* Can we hold the hackathon **in person** at the university? Yes, universities that wish can make a room available to their students (and participants from the same city) where they can meet and develop their projects in person. Let us know so we can help you.

  
‚û°Ô∏è Send us an email to info@somosnlp.org, We count on you and your students!

If you are a student and would like your university to participate in the hackathon, tell your teacher!
