To promote different skills in our community, we want to allow you to design the hackathon poster this year. The objectives of this year's hackathon are the creation of a quality Spanish corpus that includes the varieties of this rich language spoken by 600M people and to start a leaderboard that allows us to evaluate LLMs in Spanish. Show your most artistic version and help us create the poster!

## üé® How to participate

1. Design a poster (o more)
2. [Send it to us](https://forms.gle/iJrKZtBXvnAk5Ji38) before January 30th
3. We will publicly thank all proposals (if you want, of course)
4. If you win, your poster will be the image of the 2024 hackathon!

## ‚úÖ What does the poster have to include

- Dimensions: 1280 √ó 720 minimum with 16:9 aspect ratio
- Title: #Somos600M

## üìù Notes

- Creations must be original
- The use of all types of design tools is allowed, including AI systems
- It will be necessary to be transparent regarding the use of AI

## ü§î Inspiration

- For example, in the edition of [2023](https://somosnlp.org/hackathon-2023) we use Midjourney for the creation of the "person-book"
- It may help you to think that, once the hackathon poster has been selected, we will have to design posters for the talks

We look forward to your posters! ü§©

<!-- Idea: Twitter thread with the posters in order of delivery -->
