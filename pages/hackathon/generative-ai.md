bio: "I was a Particle Physicist with experience at CERN (Geneva) and CEA Saclay (France) before becoming an entrepreneur. For the last 10 years, I have built startups with a focus on solving problems at scale. Recently, I stumbled upon the problem of expensive computing and created Q Blocks with my brother to solve this for millions of developers that still can't access computing. 
Our vision with Q Blocks is to help more than 100 million developers all over the world build powerful and innovative applications in the field of AI.
Big fan of Money Heist."

## ¿Qué vas a aprender al asistir a esta charla?

In this talk we will share our point of view about the future of computing and generative AI, and how the developers can today start working on building their empires using these AI models.

We will present the how of this, from optimization of model to the GPU itself: Whisper API example.

Finally we will announce the surprise for the hackathon participants and a demo of the LLM API.
