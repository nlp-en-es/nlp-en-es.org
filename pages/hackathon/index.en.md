We are 600M people speaking Spanish, and we plan to give our widespread (and beautiful) language a fair representation in the NLP context. Our mission at SomosNLP is to democratize and accelerate advances of NLP in Spanish 🚀 

After two editions with more than 1,000 participants from 30 different countries, we exceeded 10,000 views of our events, learned from 20 speakers, completed 50 projects with social impact, and published 3 papers... We are back for that and much more! 💪

Join the third edition of the largest open-source Natural Language Processing hackathon in Spanish!

The democratization of LNP in Spanish is the main objective of SomosNLP and we believe that one of the best ways to move towards this goal is by promoting the creation of more open NLP resources in our language.

Given the incredible revolution of LLMs, we want to focus this hackathon on two objectives:
1. Create a **quality corpus that represents the varieties of Spanish of the 600M Spanish-speaking people.** 💛
2. Create a **leaderboard of LLMs in Spanish** that allows standardizing the evaluation of progress and comparing the available models. 🚀
